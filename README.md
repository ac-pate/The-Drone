# The-Drone

## Project Statement

The objective of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a custom remote-controlled (RC) drone that showcases advanced features such as autonomous flight, real-time FPV (First Person View) video transmission, obstacle avoidance, and robust navigation capabilities. This project involves a multidisciplinary team working collaboratively to integrate skills and technologies in aerodynamics, electronics, design, and software development.

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Prototype Development

- **Objective:** Build a functional prototype using readily available spare parts and online drone kits.
- **Tasks:**
  - Assemble the drone with off-the-shelf flight controllers and proprietary software.
  - Gain practical insights into drone design and the necessary electronics.
- **Outcome:** Achieve a working drone to inform the design and component selection for custom development.

### Phase 2: Final Custom Drone Design and Development

- **Objective:** Design and build a custom drone using advanced components and 3D printing technology.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a custom drone frame primarily through 3D printing.
  - Integrate more powerful motors and custom electronics.
  - Implement a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller (or another suitable flight controller ESP32 for WiFi capabilities, or the newer [Arduino Nano ESP/Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BfnudFxDo8) boards with inbuilt IMU) with custom flight software for full control.
  - Develop software for motor control, IMU calibration, and self-stabilization.
  - Add an FPV camera for real-time first-person view through FPV goggles and a secondary camera for recording.
- **Outcome:** Develop a fully functional custom drone with enhanced performance and embedded control capabilities.

### Phase 3: Autonomous Features, Gesture Control, and Advanced Capabilities

- **Objective:** Integrate advanced autonomous functionalities and perfect the drone for professional use like gesture control takeoff and landing.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement obstacle avoidance, return to base, and pathfinding algorithms.
  - Develop a system to send telemetry data to a ground station during flight.
  - Create a 360-degree FPV system, allowing drone control based on the orientation of FPV goggles, with joystick control limited to vertical and horizontal movements.
  - Design and produce a high-quality PCB to streamline the drone's electronics for professional presentation and competition.
- **Outcome:** A sophisticated, competition-ready drone with comprehensive autonomous features and high-quality design running Image Recognition model to act on gestures.
